# Aether Tuner

**Your Web-Based Radionics Machine**

Aether Tuner is an interactive, free Radionics machine that transforms your intention into a unique 9-digit "Rate." This Rate is then expressed through modulated brown noise and dynamic visual patterns, based on numerological principles.

## What is it for?

*   **Enhancing Focus:** Aether Tuner can aid concentration by providing Rate-based brown noise, subtly complemented by 8Hz binaural beats, ideal for work or study.
*   **Broadcasting Your Intention:** Practitioners of Radionics believe that a Rate generated from an intention can activate and broadcast specific energy patterns, potentially influencing the world's information field. Experiment by generating Rates for keywords you resonate with, such as prosperity, peace, or love.
*   **Meditation & Relaxation:** The combination of 8Hz binaural beats and brown noise can help create a state conducive to creative focus or peaceful meditation. Using Aether Tuner as a meditation aid is a great way to explore its effects.

## How to Use

1.  In the **INTENTION** area, freely write your wishes, goals, or any concept you wish to explore.
2.  Press the **"Activate"** button. Aether Tuner will generate a unique Rate number, and corresponding sounds and visual patterns will be created.
3.  Optionally, set the **TIMER** in minutes for focused work or meditation sessions. Setting it to 0 enables continuous operation (infinite mode).
4.  To stop Aether Tuner, simply press the **"Deactivate"** button.
5.  Choose your preferred **COLOR THEME** for a personalized visual experience.

**TIP:** Aether Tuner is a tool for personal exploration and discovery; there's no single "right" way to use it. Feel free to experiment with various intentions and experience the unique interplay of patterns and sounds that emerge.
